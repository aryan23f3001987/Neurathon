"Trump's embattled education department pick may face Senate fight WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Billionaire philanthropist Betsy DeVos, already known as one of the most controversial nominees for education secretary in U.S. history, now risks a rare congressional rejection. The deeply divided U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee on Tuesday agreed to send her nomination to the full chamber for a vote, the final step in the confirmation process.  But the committee’s executive session showed DeVos faces choppy waters ahead for a post for which there is typically little congressional debate or public attention. The chairman, Republican Lamar Alexander, acted as tie-breaker after all 11 Republicans voted for Republican President Donald Trump’s pick and all 11 Democrats voted against. Two Republicans - Maine’s Susan Collins and Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski - expressed grave misgivings about the charter school advocate’s limited experience with public schools. They said they voted yes only so the entire Senate can debate whether DeVos is the right fit. Murkowski said she may not support DeVos in the Senate vote. Democrats said the nomination was rushed, with DeVos providing answers they described as vague and noncommittal to hundreds of written questions only 24 hours before the vote.  After many of Trump’s nominees sailed through their confirmations in recent weeks, the names currently before the Senate were meeting resistance. The Senate’s 48 Democrats only need to pull three Republicans to their side to reject DeVos’ nomination. Just nine nominees have ever been turned down by the Senate. Public opposition to DeVos is unusually fierce, said Mary Kusler, lobbyist for the National Education Association, a large union that said constituents sent 1 million emails and placed 40,000 calls to senators decrying the nomination.  It was the biggest public outcry over an education secretary that Kusler has seen in her career of more than 20 years, she added. NEA and the American Federation of Teachers, another major union, say they will keep up their anti-DeVos fight during the Senate vote and expect voters will also maintain pressure. Public opinion of DeVos wobbled after her Jan. 17 hearing, where she suggested allowing guns at rural schools to fend off bear attacks.  At two rallies on Tuesday in Chicago, several hundred protesters gathered to demonstrate against DeVos’ nomination.   “I have one child in school, and my son will be (in school) in a little over a year,” said Chicago resident Mara Tierney, who attended a rally with her 3-year-old boy. “I want to do what I can to ensure DeVos is not confirmed.” Old-guard Republicans like former first lady Barbara Bush defended DeVos as a lifelong champion of low-income children, literacy and giving parents more choice in education. Democrats, meanwhile, blasted the nominee for supporting privatization in ways they said hurt poor students, not understanding basic education laws and issues, and courting potential conflicts of interest through her investments.  politicsNews",1
"U.S. to apply 'extreme vetting' in refugee swap deal with Australia SYDNEY (Reuters) - The United States will apply ‘extreme vetting’ to up to 1,250 asylum seekers it has agreed to resettle as part of a deal with Australia, a spokesman for President Trump said in the United States on Tuesday. Washington agreed on a deal late last year to resettle asylum seekers, mainly from Afghanistan, Iran and Iraq, held in Australia’s processing centers on remote Pacific islands in Papua New Guinea and Nauru. Under the deal, Australia would in return resettle refugees from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Providing details of the plan for the first time, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the deal covered many of the refugees held in the two offshore processing centers, although they must satisfy recently tightened immigration policies. “The deal specifically deals with 1,250 people that are mostly in Papua New Guinea being held,” Spicer told reporters in Washington. “Part of the deal is that they have to be vetted in the same manner that we’re doing now. There will be extreme vetting applied to all of them,” he said. Trump’s executive order last week suspended the U.S. refugee program and restricted entry to the United States from majority-Muslim countries Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, casting doubt over the deal with Australia. Despite the restrictions, Trump assured Australia on Sunday the United States would honor its agreement to resettle the asylum seekers. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull dismissed speculation in domestic media that Trump had not yet committed fully to the deal. “The Trump administration has committed to progress with the arrangements to honor the deal,” Turnbull told reporters in Canberra on Wednesday. “That was the assurance the president gave me when we spoke on the weekend,” he said.     Australia’s hardline immigration policy is a contentious issue that has drawn international condemnation from the United Nations and other rights groups, but which remains popular at home and has bipartisan political support. Some 1,161 men, women and children remain in indefinite detention in Manus Island and Nauru as of Nov. 30, the most recent data from Australia’s Department of Immigration shows. Another 1,000 or so people are in detention in Australia, some of them asylum seekers transported from Manus Island and Nauru for medical treatment. It was not clear how many of these would be eligible under the deal with the United States. U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials have begun assessing the asylum seekers, although there is no timeline for resettlement.  politicsNews",1
"Back road drive, secret flight brought Trump's court pick to Washington WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A secret meeting at a neighbor’s house, a drive through a back country road, and a clandestine flight on a military jet marked Judge Neil Gorsuch’s journey to the White House this week after U.S. President Donald Trump chose him as his Supreme Court nominee. Trump, who took office on January 20, called Gorsuch on Monday to inform him that he had prevailed among a handful of finalists to succeed deceased Justice Antonin Scalia on the high court. That decision set off a rapid and secretive process to get Gorsuch to Washington without alerting journalists and other Supreme Court watchers of the president’s selection. After Trump called the Colorado-based judge, a team from the White House counsel’s office flew to Denver and then drove to Boulder, roughly 45 minutes away, to meet with Gorsuch and his family. They met at a neighbor’s house to avoid detection.  Then the White House staff spirited him though a “back farm road” to a waiting military plane to transport him to Washington, White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters on Tuesday night in the White House East Room. Gorsuch stayed at a friend’s residence before being brought to the White House for the Tuesday evening announcement. The secrecy continued up until the last minute. When Trump, a former reality television star, entered the East Room, he came alone, addressing the cameras and the waiting crowd, which included Scalia’s widow, at a podium before calling on Gorsuch and his wife to come in. Trump’s decision came after he narrowed a list of 21 candidates down to six, including Thomas Hardiman, William Pryor, Amul Thapar, Diane Sykes, and Don Willett. Then President-elect Trump interviewed Gorsuch, Hardiman and Pryor on Jan. 14 in his New York residence. He also interviewed Thapar. “He finalized the decision recently,” after considering all 21 candidates “very deeply,” said Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser and counselor to the president. White House counsel Don McGahn informed Hardiman, Pryor and Thapar that they had not been chosen, Spicer said.  The White House was determined to keep the president’s Supreme Court selection a secret and make the announcement of his choice a success after the botched rollout of his refugee executive order contributed to confusion and worldwide criticism last weekend. The strategy to get Gorsuch confirmed will kick off right away, Spicer said, with former Senator Kelly Ayotte serving as the “sherpa” to help steer the nominee through the Senate confirmation process.  politicsNews",1
"Trump's Supreme Court nominee questions power of administrative agencies NEW YORK (Reuters) - Supreme Court nominee Judge Neil Gorsuch is known for questioning how far courts should go in deferring to federal agencies on interpreting the law, a view that could be important for U.S. companies and, perhaps, for President Donald Trump. Nominated by Trump on Tuesday to fill a vacancy on the nation’s highest court, the 49-year-old Gorsuch is widely viewed as a sharp-eyed jurist and a crisp writer who has the potential to be a persuasive voice on the court. In a recent case, Gorsuch took a dim view of a landmark 1984 high court ruling, Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council. Widely cited, the ruling directed judges nationwide to defer to agencies’ interpretation of laws that may be ambiguous. It is known as “Chevron deference.”  Last August, in a case over immigration rules, Gorsuch called the doctrine the “elephant in the room” that concentrates federal power “in a way that seems more than a little difficult to square with the Constitution.” Showing his willingness to tackle the issue head on, he added, “Maybe the time has come to face the behemoth.” If Gorsuch can persuade other Supreme Court justices to question Chevron deference, companies arguing before the high court against federal regulations might have a better chance on issues ranging from the environment to immigration. At the same time, broader skepticism of deference to agencies could have long-term consequences for Trump. The new president is moving swiftly to reshape the federal bureaucracy, appointing agency heads who could upend the legacy of President Barack Obama on emissions, health care and internet policy. The court’s views on agencies’ agendas will be critical. “The idea that President Trump of all people would be the one to choose a justice who might push the court to reduce the executive power is pretty ironic,” said John Nagle, a professor at the University of Notre Dame Law School. If the Supreme Court were to overturn or limit the Chevron precedent, lower courts could become more active in deciding the ultimate meaning of a statute, making it less likely that an agency’s view would stand, Nagle said.  “It could make it more difficult for the Trump administration to defend some of its regulatory actions in federal court,” said Case Western Reserve University School of Law professor Jonathan Adler.  Republicans in Congress, particularly when Obama was in office, frequently complained about Chevron deference. They have even debated legislation that would override it. The House of Representatives passed such a bill on Jan. 11, although it is unlikely to win approval in the Senate. Gorsuch is not the first judge to take aim at the issue. In 2015, the Supreme Court ruled against the Environmental Protection Agency over its regulations for limiting pollution from mercury and other toxic materials. At that time, conservative Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a separate opinion saying the government’s position “raises serious questions about the constitutionality of our broader practice of deferring to agency interpretations of federal statutes.” While Thomas has argued the doctrine threatens the Constitutionally-mandated separation of the different branches of government, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy have said it may threaten individual liberties, said Andrew Grossman, a conservative lawyer who has represented companies challenging government regulations. “Gorsuch may be the one to bring the court together on fundamental questions of administrative power that have sparked so much controversy and divisiveness in recent years,” Grossman said. Some court-watchers say that in practice the justices are inclined to support executive actions that are in keeping with their own views. But an analysis of their votes carried out by Jack Beermann, a professor at Boston University School of Law, showed that such an outcome is not uniform.  politicsNews",1
"Highlights: The Trump presidency on January 31 at 8:11 P.M. EST/0111 GMT (Reuters) - Highlights of the day for U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration on Tuesday: Trump nominates Neil Gorsuch for a lifetime job on the U.S. Supreme Court, picking the 49-year-old federal appeals court judge to restore the court’s conservative majority and help shape rulings on divisive issues such as abortion, gun control, the death penalty and religious rights.  Nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries temporarily blocked from entering the United States by Trump’s executive order may be blocked indefinitely, and others might be added to the list, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly says.  The United States will apply “extreme vetting” to up to 1,250 asylum seekers it has agreed to resettle as part of an agreement with Australia, a Trump spokesman says.  Legal challenges to Trump’s first moves on immigration spread as three states sue over his order on travel from seven majority-Muslim countries and San Francisco sues over his order on sanctuary cities.  Americans are sharply divided over the executive order on immigration, with slightly more approving it than disapproving, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll.  Ronald Vitiello has been appointed chief of the U.S. Border Patrol, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters, replacing Mark Morgan, who had been asked to step down.  The new U.S. ambassador to the United Nations warns Iran its testing two days ago of a long-range ballistic missile is unacceptable and an act the United States believes violates its nuclear accord with world powers.  Trump calls on the pharmaceutical industry to boost U.S. production and lower prices, and vows to speed approval for new medicines.  U.S. Senate Democrats postpone votes on several of Trump’s Cabinet nominees - including attorney general and Treasury secretary - citing their responsibility to do a “thorough vetting,” while Republicans accuse them of unreasonable delays in considering the picks.  About 900 State Department officials sign an internal dissent memo criticizing Trump’s order on refugees and travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries, a source says.  Trump and a top economics adviser unleash a barrage of criticism against Germany, Japan and China, saying the three key U.S. trading partners were engaged in devaluing their currencies to the detriment of American companies and consumers.  U.S. food producers and shippers are trying to rush exports to Mexico and line up alternative markets as concerns rise that their business will be hurt by trade and immigration clashes between Trump and the Mexican government.   politicsNews",1
"Germany's Schulz calls Trump 'un-American', warns against lifting Russia sanctions BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany’s center-left chancellor candidate Martin Schulz has criticized U.S. President Donald Trump’s policies as “un-American” and warned against lifting sanctions imposed against Russia over its role in the Ukraine crisis. In one of the sharpest remarks yet by a senior German politician since the new American leader took office, Schulz told the Funke media group in an interview published on Wednesday that Europe had to stand up to defend liberal values. “What Trump is doing is un-American,” Schulz said, adding that the United States like no other country in the world stood for enlightenment, democracy and freedom. “If Trump is now driving a wrecking ball through this set of values, then I will tell him as chancellor: That’s not the policy of Germany and Europe,” Schulz added. Germany’s Social Democrats last week nominated former European Parliament president Schulz to run against Chancellor Angela Merkel in a federal election in September, and the surprise move has boosted popular support for the centre-left party. Merkel said on Monday the global fight against terrorism does not warrant putting groups of people under suspicion, adding Trump’s order to restrict people from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States violates the spirit of international cooperation. Turning to Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Ukraine conflict, Schulz said that sanctions imposed against Russia could only be lifted after both sides had implemented the so-called Minsk peace plan. “As long as the Minsk peace agreement is not fully implemented, the sanctions cannot be lifted. We must tell Putin very clearly that Russia is obliged to respect and defend international law,” Schulz said. Schulz’ comments bring more clarity about his stance on Russia after some leading Social Democrats have voiced support for a partial lifting of sanctions as long as Russia is implementing some aspects of the plan. Merkel, one of the architects of the peace deal, has repeatedly said that sanctions against Russia can only be lifted once the Minsk agreement has been fully implemented.  politicsNews",1
"Trump pushes drugmakers for lower prices, more U.S. production WASHINGTON/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump in a meeting on Tuesday with pharmaceutical executives called on them to manufacture more of their drugs in the United States and cut prices, while vowing to speed approval of new medicines and ease regulation.  Trump told them the government was paying “astronomical” prices for medicines in its health programs for older, disabled and poor people and said he would soon appoint a new U.S. Food and Drug Administration leader. “We’re going to streamline the FDA,” Trump said in a statement, referring to the regulatory agency responsible for vetting that new drugs are safe and effective. The meeting between Trump and the pharmaceutical executives signaled a defusing of tensions that have kept drug stock prices in check since the presidential election. Shares of most of the group rallied on Tuesday following the meeting, even as the broader stock market slid. “Trump is a populist above all else, and having these (drug) prices skyrocket, he’s commented that under his administration, this is not going to happen,” said market strategist Quincy Crosby of Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey. She said Trump was playing a balancing act between controlling prices and loosening regulations. “I don’t think the majority of Americans want all regulations lifted from drug makers.” Attending the meeting were top executives at Merck & Co Inc, Johnson &, Celgene Corp, Eli Lilly & Co, Amgen Inc and Switzerland’s Novartis AG <NOV N.S> as well as the head of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) lobbying group.  According to a transcript of the televised portion of the meeting, Amgen Chief Executive Officer Robert Brad way promised to add 1,600 U.S. jobs at his California-based biotechnology company this year.  Amgen clarified in an email that it currently employs around 20,000 people worldwide, including 12,000 in the United States, and said the 1,600 includes new staff as well as hires to address attrition.  Celgene, Lilly, Merck and Amgen said by email after the meeting that they were encouraged by Trump’s focus on innovation, tax reform and the need for a more value-driven health care system. Lilly said discussion topics also included stronger trade agreements and removing “outdated regulations that drive up costs and slow innovation.” PhRMA echoed those points in its own post-meeting statement, adding that the policies, if enacted, would result in up to 350,000 new jobs over the next 10 years. “Tax, deregulation - those are things that could really help us expand operations,” Lilly CEO Dave Ricks said. Officials at Novartis and J&J did not immediately respond to requests for additional comment.  Shares of the six companies were mostly higher, for an overall gain averaging 0.7 percent, compared with a 0.4 percent drop in the broad S&P 500. The Nasdaq Biotech Index was up 1.2 percent, reversing earlier losses, and the S&P 500 health care index gained 0.6 percent.      “We have to get prices down for a lot of reasons. We have no choice, for Medicare and Medicaid,” Trump said, citing the nation’s government insurance programs for the elderly, the poor and the disabled. Trump also said currency devaluation by other countries had increased drugmakers’ outsourcing their production, and he called on the companies to make more of their products in the United States.  Foreign countries must pay a fair share for drug development costs, he added. “We’re going to end global freeloading.”   The United States typically pays more for drugs than any other developed nation. Most Western European countries, as well as Japan, have government-run health care coverage under which drug prices are negotiated.  High drug prices have become a national issue during the past two years as healthcare costs have risen Trump spooked pharmaceutical and biotech investors by saying on Jan. 11, before his inauguration, that drug companies were “getting away with murder” on what they charged the government for medicine and that he would do something about it.  Company executives, meanwhile, have tried to tread a careful line in defending their industry while expressing optimism that the United States would continue to reward scientific advances.  “Regulations - great, streamlining the FDA, perhaps,” Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago said. “But if Trump is going to address his constituency, drug prices have to come down. So I think this is maybe a Pyrrhic victory.”  politicsNews",1
"Trump immigration order may require legislation: U.S. lawmakers WASHINGTON (Reuters) - After days of chaos at airports and confusion over details of President Donald Trump’s immigration executive order, some of his fellow Republicans joined Democrats in saying Congress might need to consider legislation to address his new policies. Republican Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said it was too early to know all the implications of Trump’s order banning travel into the United States by citizens of seven majority-Muslim nations, but lawmakers might eventually need to step in to modify it. “Seriously, we still don’t know all the implications of what happened. I don’t think they (the Trump administration) know all the implications of what happened,” he told reporters at the U.S. Capitol. “There may well need to be a legislative fix.” Under the executive order Trump released on Friday, travelers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen may not enter the United States for at least 90 days while Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and others determine whether there is enough information available to screen them. Democrats in both the Senate and House of Representatives  have introduced bills to rescind Trump’s order, but those measures are not expected to go anywhere in the Republican-led Congress. Senator John McCain, the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has criticized the order, saying it could weaken U.S. counterterrorism efforts. He blasted barring Iraqis who risked their lives to work as interpreters for U.S. forces, who have already undergone extensive screening. McCain and Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen led a push to pass legislation last year to provide visas to those Iraqis. McCain said he thought Iraq should not be on Trump’s list. He said it could invite retaliation by Baghdad and said that Iraq should not be lumped in with frequent U.S. nemesis Iran. “There’s no comparison. There’s thousands of Americans fighting in Iraq as we speak. And what if the Iraqis decided, OK, we’re not going to let all these contractors (working with U.S. forces) ... have visas to come into our country?” McCain asked. Iraq’s prime minister on Tuesday said the country would not retaliate to Trump’s travel ban against Iraqi nationals because it did not want to lose Washington’s cooperation in the war on Islamic State. McCain said whether legislation was needed would depend on how the executive order was implemented over time. “Let’s see what they do,” McCain said. “General Kelly today made some very significant changes to what was initially publicized. So let’s see what they do.”  politicsNews",1
"Acting SEC chair seeks to scale back 'conflict minerals' rule WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top Republican at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday took the first step toward scaling back the controversial “conflict minerals” rule, which requires companies to trace whether their products contain minerals from a war-torn part of Africa. In his first major action since becoming acting SEC chair earlier this month, Michael Piwowar announced he has directed agency staff to reconsider how companies should comply with the rule and whether “additional relief” from its requirements is necessary.  Piwowar’s action comes just one day after President Donald Trump signed an executive order that aims to slash government regulations. The White House has said the order does not apply to independent agencies like the SEC. However, independent agencies often try to voluntarily follow the spirit of such orders. The conflict minerals rule requires manufacturers, from Apple Inc to General Electric Co, to tell investors if their products contain certain minerals from the war-torn Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is one of several SEC disclosure rules required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank law that Republicans and business groups have long sought to repeal, saying they force companies to furnish politically charged information that is irrelevant to making investment decisions. Another disclosure rule hated by many companies that was also in Dodd-Frank is the “resource extraction” rule, which forces oil and gas companies to disclose payments to foreign governments.  Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives are slated to vote on a measure to repeal the resource extraction rule on Wednesday. In that case, Republicans are seeking to repeal it under  the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to stop recently adopted regulations through a simple majority vote. The conflict minerals rule cannot be repealed through the Congressional Review Act because the law can only be applied to rules adopted since the end of May. However, SEC staff can issue interpretive guidance to scale back its requirements or, in a more aggressive move, staff can choose not to enforce it. Piwowar said the SEC will solicit comments from the public on whether SEC staff should update its guidance on compliance. The Dodd-Frank law also contains language which would let Trump order the SEC to temporarily suspend the conflict minerals rule for two years if it might harm national security. Piwowar did not ask the president to take such a step. However, he did raise some national security concerns posed by the rule, and said it has done nothing to help the humanitarian crisis in Africa.  politicsNews",1
"Factbox: Trump U.S. Supreme Court pick could affect pending cases (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court, due to be named on Tuesday, could have an immediate impact on cases already pending before the justices. The nine-seat court has been operating with only eight justices since the death of conservative Antonin Scalia on Feb. 13, 2016, with four liberals and four conservatives. The court has ended up with 4-4 split decisions in several cases. The new justice could cast the deciding vote in some cases being considered by the justices in their term that ends in June. Here is a look at some cases in which the new justice could be pivotal. Gloucester County School Board v. G.G. A major transgender rights dispute over whether a public school district in Virginia can prevent a female-born transgender student who identifies as male from using the boys’ bathroom. Trinity Lutheran Church v. Pauley A religious rights case from Missouri in which a church contends the state violated the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment guarantee of religious freedom by denying it funds for a playground project due to a state ban on aid to religious organizations. Epic Systems Corp v. Lewis A significant case for business and labor on whether companies can head off costly class action lawsuits by forcing employees to give up their right to pursue work-related legal claims in court as a group. Microsoft Corp v. Baker A class action case on Microsoft Corp’s bid to fend off claims by Xbox 360 owners who contend that the videogame console has a design defect that causes game discs to be gouged.  politicsNews",1
"A barb at Germany puts Trump administration on collision course with EU WASHINGTON (Reuters) - For seven years, the United States has fought to keep the euro zone intact, urging European officials toward action and supporting international bailout programs to keep the 17-nation currency union from cracking apart.  That appears to have changed less than two weeks into Donald Trump’s new administration.  A sharp shift in tone toward Germany, casting the euro as fuel for that country’s massive trade surplus, has raised concerns that the U.S. president’s trade-centric world view may see the euro not as a geopolitical plus, but as another needless bit of multilateralism. While Trump has refrained from commenting directly on the euro, he praised Britain’s decision to exit the European Union as a “great thing” and predicted that others would leave the bloc as the result of an influx of refugees. In comments published in the European press on Tuesday, Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro said the “grossly undervalued” euro served as a currency for Germany alone, allowing the country to “exploit” the United States and others. On Capitol Hill, Treasury Secretary-designate Steven Mnuchin softened the traditional U.S. “strong dollar” mantra, suggesting that the dollar’s current strength may be working against what has become perhaps the administration’s central economic priority: reviving U.S. manufacturing and exports. Framed narrowly, that could put the United States on a clear a collision course with Germany, the world’s fourth-largest economy and home to companies that rival top U.S. industrial giants, as it is with Mexico or China.  “There seems to be this desire to go back to a divide and conquer style strategy where the U.S. negotiates against individual countries,” said Douglas Rediker, executive chair of International Capital Strategies and a former U.S. executive board member at the International Monetary Fund.  “To single (Germany) out when they don’t have authority to manipulate their currency, requires you to make a leap - which is to say that ‘We don’t care that there actually is a common currency. We are going to take you to account.’” Monetary policy in the euro zone is set by the European Central Bank, and it is the ECB’s money creation policies that have contributed to the euro’s recent decline in value.  Like the U.S. Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing, those efforts have been regarded internationally as a reasonable response to the region’s dangerous economic weakness - not as an effort to cheapen the currency to gain a trade advantage.  “The question is how far will the new administration go with this?” said Jeromin Zettelmeyer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a former German economic official. Trump could, for example, try to tax German goods to offset any perceived advantage gained from a cheap euro, Zettelmeyer said. An import duty has already been suggested as a way to redress alleged currency manipulation by China. “Trump seems to think that having a trade deficit with another country means that the other country is somehow stealing or at least getting the better deal,” said Zettelmeyer. The first days of Trump’s administration have touched off a wave of anxiety in Europe. European Council President Donald Tusk went so far as to list the new government in Washington among the chief “external” threats faced by Europe. Criticism of Germany’s trade surplus, however, is not unique to Trump.  The Treasury Department under President Obama added Germany to a “watch list” because of its large trade imbalances. The U.S. trade deficit with Germany stood at $77 billion as of 2015, three times that of other European Union countries combined, and $20 billion more than the deficit with Mexico, one of Trump’s other economic nemeses.   But for Obama officials, the aim was to get Germany to spend more and boost its imports of goods from the rest of Europe and the rest of the world. It was not to target the euro’s value and, by extension, the steps taken by the ECB to revive European growth more broadly. Partly under American influence, the Group of 20 nations, including China, has in recent years agreed to consensus language that countries would “refrain from competitive devaluations.”  They have also generally avoided criticizing each other’s central banks. That diplomacy is credited at least in part for China’s recent shift toward a more flexible currency regime that organizations like the International Monetary Fund feel have brought the renminbi currency close to fair market value. In their last report on the euro zone, IMF staff said they did think the euro was undervalued. But they said the range could be anywhere from 0 to 10 percent, though likely larger for Germany. “The consequences (of a protectionist United States) affect us Germans as a leading export and import nation particularly hard,” Federation of German Industries chief Dieter Kempf said in a speech in Berlin after the Navarro comments.  politicsNews",1
"Trump to nominate Rod Rosenstein to be deputy U.S. attorney general WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will nominate U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein to be deputy attorney general, the White House said on Tuesday, one day after Trump fired the acting attorney general for refusing to enforce an immigration order. The White House also said Trump will nominate Rachel Brand to be associate attorney general and Steven Engel to be an assistant attorney general, filling senior positions as the Justice Department awaits Senate confirmation of Jeff Sessions to be attorney general.  politicsNews",1
"U.S. House Republicans finalize list of rules to kill in Wednesday vote WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans pressed ahead in their deregulatory push on Tuesday, with the U.S. House of Representatives Rules Committee officially adding a regulation on methane and one intended to root out pay discrimination to the list of rules the whole chamber will vote to kill on Wednesday. On Monday, the committee sent three other recently enacted rules on the environment, corruption and guns to the full House to axe under the Congressional Review Act, which has only been used effectively once, in 2001.  The Republican-controlled House is expected to vote to overturn all five regulations on Wednesday, and then hand them off to the Senate. Agencies cannot create a new rule to replace any part of an overturned regulation, and Democrats at Tuesday’s committee hearing argued that House Republicans were closing off the possibility of enacting regulations that could be needed in the future.  They also pressed for more time to consider rolling back regulations that often took months and years to craft. “What we’ve been doing today and yesterday ... I would characterize as mindless legislating,” said Representative Jim McGovern, a Democrat from Massachusetts. “I worry that this whole process is going to subject a lot of vulnerable people, and a lot of working people, as well as our environment to some pretty dark consequences.” New York’s Louise Slaughter, the committee’s senior Democrat, while talking about the methane rule during the one-hour hearing bluntly said: “I disagree wholeheartedly with what you’re doing.” Democrats, though, have little power to stop the overturning of regulations. Only simple majorities in both chambers are needed to kill a rule. In the past, Republicans’ nullification attempts were met with veto threats by former president Barack Obama, a Democrat. Now, a fellow Republican occupies the White House, President Donald Trump. Critics of the methane rule say the regulation, which covers emissions from oil and gas operations on federal and Indian land, is not necessary. They cast it as a duplicative regulation that usurps state rights and slows down the distribution of natural gas through excessive red tape. Supporters, meanwhile, say that the rule keeps oil and gas companies from polluting the environment, brings in royalties to the federal government, and reduces wasted methane. Those wanting to see the pay-discrimination rule overturned have similar complaints, saying that other rules already cover the area and that requiring federal contractors to collect information on their employees will be expensive and time-consuming.  politicsNews",1
"Ronald Vitiello appointed chief of U.S. Border Patrol WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ronald Vitiello has been appointed chief of the U.S. Border Patrol, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters on Tuesday, replacing Mark Morgan, who had been asked to step down as the agency moves toward tougher immigration enforcement under the Trump administration.

"U.S. Senate approves Chao to lead Transportation Department WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Elaine Chao, a former top U.S. labor official, was sworn in on Tuesday to lead the U.S. Transportation Department, which overseas aviation, vehicle, train and pipeline safety. Chao, a former U.S. labor secretary and deputy transportation secretary, took office hours after the U.S. Senate voted 93 to 6 to confirm her. Chao, 63, will face key decisions on how to regulate the growing use of drones and automakers’ plans to offer self-driving cars.   She will also be a key player in President Donald Trump’s Cabinet if his administration pushes ahead with a major infrastructure spending program, as the businessman-turned-politician promised during last year’s presidential campaign. “Your leadership and your experience will serve well as the secretary of transportation, overseeing what we anticipate will be historic investments in our nation’s roads, bridges, airports and above all in our future,” said Vice President Mike Pence, who administered the oath of office to Chao. Chao tweeted: “It is an honor to rejoin the extraordinary people of @USDOT and begin working to rebuild America’s infrastructure.” The Transportation Department has a $75 billion annual budget and about 60,000 employees. It includes the Federal Aviation Administration, which handles air traffic control. Chao, the wife of Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the first Asian-American woman to hold a Cabinet position, also will have to decide whether U.S. fuel efficiency standards should be revised, as some automakers have sought. There are dozens of other pending regulatory issues facing the next administration, including railroad safety and staffing rules and whether to set rules requiring airlines to give more passengers with disabilities seats with extra leg room and whether to ban or restrict personal phone calls on U.S. flights. At her confirmation hearing this month, Chao declined to take positions on a number of issues, including whether air traffic control jobs should be privatized, concerns over the safety of shipments of crude oil by rail, foreign airlines’ push to move into the U.S. market and regulation of developing technologies. AAA, the largest U.S. auto club with more than 50 million members, praised Chao’s confirmation. AAA CEO Marshall Doney said the group “firmly believes that significant, additional investments are needed to maintain existing infrastructure and to enhance the nation’s (transportation) system.” The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which represents major U.S. and foreign automakers, said that from “autonomous vehicles to safety to fuel efficiency to infrastructure, Secretary Chao’s leadership will profoundly impact our sector and many others.”  politicsNews",1
"About 900 State Department officials sign protest memo: source WASHINGTON (Reuters) - About 900 U.S. State Department officials signed an internal dissent memo protesting a travel ban by U.S. President Donald Trump on refugees and travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries, a source familiar with the document said on Tuesday, in a rebellion against the new president’s policies. A senior State Department official confirmed the memorandum had been submitted to acting Secretary of State Tom Shannon through the department's ""dissent channel,"" a process in which officials can express unhappiness over policy (bit.ly/2jOYW0y). White House spokesman Sean Spicer said on Monday he was aware of the memo but warned career diplomats that they should either “get with the program or they can go.”  A draft of the dissent memo seen by Reuters argued that the executive order would sour relations with affected countries, inflame anti-American sentiment and hurt those who sought to visit the United Spates for humanitarian reasons. It said the policy “runs counter to core American values of non-discrimination, fair play and extending a warm welcome to foreign visitors and immigrants. Trump on Friday signed an executive order that temporarily  bans refugees and people from seven Muslim-majority countries, sparking tumult at U.S. airports and protests in major American cities. The ban affects Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Even before the executive order on immigration was issued, concern among State Department officials had been growing over news reports that Trump was about to ease sanctions against Russia, said one State Department official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The resignation of at least four top State Department officials, including Under Secretary for Management Patrick Kennedy, who formally left the department on Tuesday, also caused some unease among diplomats who worried about a power vacuum.

"Senate Democrats delay committee votes on Sessions, Mnuchin, Price WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Democrats on Tuesday postponed votes on several of President Donald Trump’s Cabinet nominees, citing their responsibility to do a “thorough vetting,” while Republicans accused them of unreasonable delays in considering the picks. Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee exploited Senate rules to delay until Wednesday a vote on Senator Jeff Sessions’ nomination to be attorney general. That job was in the spotlight after Trump fired the acting attorney general on Monday over her refusal to defend his executive order blocking nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. Democrats also boycotted a meeting of the Senate Finance Committee where votes had been scheduled on Steve Mnuchin to be Treasury secretary and Tom Price to head the Health and Human Services Department. Since at least one Democrat is required to be present for the committee votes to take place, no votes were held. Despite the delays, all three nominees are considered likely to be confirmed once their names are sent to the full Republican-led Senate. The White House, as well as Republicans on Capitol Hill, accused Democrats of slow-walking the work of the government. “The people want change. President Trump is delivering that change. And the only response from Senate Democrats so far is to try to stall the core functions of our government,” said White House press secretary Sean Spicer. “When will the Democrats give us our Attorney General and rest of Cabinet!” Trump said in a tweet. “No wonder D.C. doesn’t work!” Senate Democrats were unapologetic, with their leader, Chuck Schumer, saying it was their obligation to “thoroughly vet” Trump’s Cabinet nominees. “And if it takes a little longer, they could be in office up to four years, and it makes eminent sense to get their views out,” Schumer told reporters. The Senate has already confirmed several of Trump’s picks for national security posts, and the chamber voted 93-6 on Tuesday to confirm Elaine Chao, wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, as head of the U.S. Transportation Department. Sessions’ closeness to Trump - he was the first senator to endorse him during Trump’s presidential campaign - was clearly working against him as far as Democrats were concerned following several days of controversy over Trump’s executive order on immigration. “We saw last night that it is also the duty of our nation’s chief law enforcement officer to support and defend the Constitution when the president’s actions do not. The attorney general swears an oath to the Constitution, not to a president,” said Senator Dick Durbin, a member of the Judiciary Committee, elaborating on his opposition to Sessions. The Judiciary Committee rescheduled its vote on Sessions for 10:30 a.m (1530 GMT) on Wednesday. Democrats on the Finance Committee said they were delaying votes on Price and Mnuchin because they wanted more information on Price’s stock trades in an Australian medical company and reports that Mnuchin’s former bank, OneWest, used automated “robo-signings” of foreclosure documents, which apparently contradicted statements the nominees had made to senators.  “We’ve made clear that we need additional information to make these judgments,” said Senator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the committee. It was unclear when the committee votes would be held. Republican Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Finance Committee, called the Democratic boycott “shocking” and “offensive.”  “What’s the matter with the other party?” he asked. “Are they that bitter about Donald Trump?”  politicsNews",1
"Some Sept. 11 families join criticism of Trump immigration order NEW YORK (Reuters) - Several relatives of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington criticized President Donald Trump’s executive order on immigration on Tuesday, saying they did not want the memories of those killed used to justify harming refugees. Trump last Friday banned travel into the United States by people from seven Muslim-majority countries, leading to protests, confusion and legal challenges. “This is totally unacceptable,” John Sigmund, whose sister, Johanna Sigmund, died inside the World Trade Center in New York on Sept. 11, 2001, told reporters on a conference call. “It goes against everything we stand for as Americans.” The text of the order specifically made reference to the hijacked plane attacks, which killed about 3,000 people. But the relatives who spoke on Tuesday pointed out that none of the Sept. 11 Islamist militant hijackers was from any of the seven countries named in Trump’s order. Trump’s order halted travel by people with passports from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days, and stopped resettlement of refugees for 120 days. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia, two from United Arab Emirates and one each from Lebanon and Egypt.  The White House has described the order as necessary “to protect the American people from terrorist attacks by foreign nationals admitted to the United States.” Sept. 11 family members said Trump’s action would sow mistrust among Muslim Americans and hurt refugees from war-torn countries. Most of the relatives are members of September 11 Families for Peaceful Tomorrows, a group formed in 2002 that opposed the war in Iraq. “I am actually sickened by President Trump’s use of 9/11 in this executive order,” said Terry McGovern, whose mother was killed at the World Trade Center. “Don’t use our loved ones, and specifically my mother, to turn away refugees.” Not all Sept. 11 families may agree, however. Kathleen Ganci, the widow of a fire department official killed in the attacks, told The New York Times she supported efforts to restrict travel to ensure national security. “There’s many, many fine Muslim people in this world, but there’s many many people who want to kill us, and we need to vet them, and we need to find out,” she was quoted as saying.  politicsNews",1
"Kushner divests equity in major NYC property NEW YORK (IFR) - Jared Kushner has divested his equity interest in 666 Fifth Avenue, a 39-story office and retail building on Manhattan’s famed shopping area, according to a spokesperson at Kushner Companies. Kushner said he would step down as CEO of Kushner Companies, a family owned real estate company, and begin to divest himself of substantial assets after he was made a senior White House advisor to US President Donald Trump, his father-in-law. “Mr. Kushner divested his equity interest in 666 Fifth Avenue, and has no role in the management or operations of the property,” a Kushner Companies spokesperson said in an emailed statement to IFR. “Mr. Kushner’s ownership interests were sold using a third-party appraisal for fair market value to a family trust, of which he is not a beneficiary,” the spokesperson said. Neither Ivanka Trump nor her and Kushner’s children are beneficiaries to the family trust, the spokesperson also confirmed. When asked by IFR, Kushner Companies declined to give any detail about the sale price of the equity stake and declined to discuss any aspect of the outstanding debt on the property. Kushner bought the property for US$1.8bn in 2007 - the highest price ever paid for a single office building sale in the United States at the time, according to Kroll Bond Rating Agency - but it was last valued well below that level. The last appraisal, completed in 2011 as part of a debt restructuring, valued the building at just US$820m. Kroll, which said the building was 20% vacant as of July 2016, valued the property at US$982.1m. Kushner and his partners in 666 Fifth took out US$1.2bn of senior debt to buy the property, which was later packaged and sold into three CMBS deals. It is not clear what the divestiture means for the debt on the property. The senior debt was restructured in 2011 and extended to February 2019. As part of the restructuring, Kushner brought in Vornado Realty as a partner. A call and email to Vornado was not immediately returned.  politicsNews",1
"Trump to order departments to beef up cyber security WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday postponed signing an executive order that is expected to require the heads of government agencies to play a more direct role in reviewing and managing risks to networks under their control. Trump, at a White House event with top officials to discuss his order, said his initiative would “hold my Cabinet secretaries and agency heads accountable, totally accountable, for the cyber security of their organizations.” “We must defend and protect federal networks,” he said. A signing ceremony was planned for Tuesday afternoon but an aide said it had been postponed. When signed, the order will give the White House budget office a central role in assessing cyber risks for the entire executive branch, and will require agency heads to develop plans to modernize aging information technology systems, a White House official told reporters, speaking on condition of anonymity. Cyber breaches featured in the run-up to the Nov. 8 election, which Trump won over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, most notably with the hacking and leaking of Democratic National Committee emails. Trump said hackers tried to penetrate the Republican National Committee as well but that they failed. Trump vowed his administration will work with the private sector to ensure owners and operators of critical infrastructure  to make sure they have the support they need from the federal government to guard against cyber threats. Trump said he would take steps to ensure cyber security is central to the U.S. military.  politicsNews",1
"Fired: Trump dumps top lawyer who defied immigration order  (In this Jan. 30 story, corrects spelling of Sergey Brin in paragraph 24) By Roberta Rampton and Julia Edwards Ainsley WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump fired top federal government lawyer Sally Yates on Monday after she took the extraordinarily rare step of defying the White House and refused to defend new travel restrictions targeting seven Muslim-majority nations. It was another dramatic twist in the unusually raucous roll-out of Trump’s directive that put a 120-day hold on allowing refugees into the country, an indefinite ban on refugees from Syria and a 90-day bar on citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The Friday night ban prompted protests and chaos at airports on the weekend as customs officials struggled to put the order into practise, and the fallout spread to U.S. markets on Monday,  where stocks suffered their biggest drop of 2017 and companies affected by the change spoke out against it. Yates said late on Monday that the Justice Department would not defend the order against court challenges, saying that she did not believe it would be “consistent with this institution’s solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right.” Hours later, she was fired. The White House said Yates “has betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States” and portrayed her actions as political. Trump has argued tougher vetting of immigrants is needed to protect America from terror attacks but critics complain that his order unfairly singles out Muslims and defiles America’s historic reputation as a welcoming place for immigrants. Yates, an appointee of former Democratic President Barack Obama, was days away from being replaced by Trump’s pick for the top spot at the Justice Department, Republican Senator Jeff Sessions, who is awaiting Senate confirmation. “Ms. Yates is an Obama Administration appointee who is weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration,” the White House said in a statement. The White House said that Dana Boente, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, was sworn in at 9 p.m. ET and would be acting U.S. attorney general until Sessions is approved. Boente said in an interview with the Washington Post that he would enforce the immigration order. There have been only a handful of instances in U.S. history of top Justice Department officials publicly breaking with the White House. The most famous example was in 1973, when then-Attorney General Elliot Richardson and his deputy resigned rather than obey President Richard Nixon’s order to fire a special prosecutor investigating the Watergate scandal. The incident, which became known as the “Saturday Night Massacre,” was a public relations disaster and is seen as a turning point in Nixon’s administration. The drama at the Justice Department is another sign of how hastily Trump’s immigration order was developed and how little it was reviewed by the agencies now grappling to implement it. The White House said key government officials were briefed before Trump signed the order on Friday, but there was little coordination or consultation, resulting in confusion. Most State Department officials found out about it from media reports. Officials from the State Department circulated a draft memo of dissent on Monday, saying Trump’s move would hurt America’s image abroad and inflame anti-American sentiment.  White House spokesman Sean Spicer dismissed the memo. “These career bureaucrats have a problem with it? I think that they should either get with the program or they can go,” he told reporters at his daily briefing. An internal Department of Homeland Security document seen by Reuters showed 348 visa holders were kept from boarding U.S.-bound flights this week, and more than 200 people came to the United States but were denied entry. More than 735 people were pulled aside for questioning by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers at airports, including 394 green card holders, who are legal permanent residents of the United States, the document said.  Trump’s administration is granting waivers from the refugee ban to allow 872 people into the country this week - refugees that had already been cleared for resettlement in the United States and were in transit when the order came out. Tens of thousands of people protested Trump’s order in major American cities and at airports on the weekend. Obama took the rare step of weighing in, saying through a spokesman that he was heartened by the political activism on the issue. Employees of Alphabet Inc’s Google in San Francisco, Mountain View, Seattle and other cities held protests. Backed by a sign that said “We are a nation of immigrants,” Sergey Brin, president of Alphabet, said he was outraged by the order. “The U.S. had the courage to take me and my family in as refugees,” he said in a YouTube video of his remarks. Federal judges blocked deportation of those detained under the order through the weekend, and more lawsuits were filed on Monday. The Council on American-Islamic Relations, the country’s biggest Muslim advocacy group, filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 people. Washington state filed a lawsuit, arguing that Trump’s order violates the equal protection clause and the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Several other Democratic state attorneys general have said they are considering legal action.  “It is an insult and a danger to all of the people of the state of Washington, of all faiths,” Washington state Governor Jay Inslee, a Democrat, told reporters. Amazon.com Inc and Expedia Inc, both of which are based in Washington state’s Seattle area, are supporting the state’s suit. Amazon scrapped a business trip for a senior company lawyer who was born in Libya but has UK citizenship, according to a declaration filed in support of the lawsuit. Forty-nine of its employees were born in one of the banned countries, and seven new hires may need to be placed in offices outside the United States, it said. A declaration from Expedia said the order could impact the travel itineraries of at least 1,000 customers, costing it refunds as well as expenses to monitor how the order is applied and who exactly is affected.     The U.S. technology industry, a major employer of foreign workers, has been the most vocal corporate opponent to Trump’s order. A group of top companies plans to meet on Tuesday to discuss how best to support legal challenges. [L1N1FL04H]  politicsNews",1
"Trump's go-to man Bannon takes hardline view on immigration WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When Donald Trump’s administration put together its controversial executive order on immigration, it was Steve Bannon – the populist firebrand fast emerging as the president’s right-hand man – pushing a hard line. Senior officials at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) interpreted the order to mean that lawful permanent residents - green card holders – who hailed from the seven Muslim-majority countries targeted in the immigration order would not face additional screening when they entered the country.  But they were quickly overruled by Bannon, who is Trump’s chief strategist and oversaw the drafting of the executive order along with White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, a close ally of Bannon’s, the officials said. “They were in charge of this operation,” one senior DHS official said, adding that the experts were “almost immediately overruled by the White House, which means by Bannon and Miller.” A senior national security official described the pair as a “tag team” pushing Trump’s key policies, including the immigration order which bars the entry of refugees and places a temporary hold on people from seven countries - Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Somalia and Libya. The inclusion of green card holders from those countries intensified opposition to an executive order that sparked legal challenges, protests at airports and sharp criticism from inside the Republican Party, including from some Trump allies. DHS officials say there was little or no White House consultation with immigration, customs and border security agencies on the immigration policy change, causing widespread confusion over how to implement Trump’s order. A senior administration official said the order went through a review by “key people” at DHS and the White House National Security Council, and that several immigration staff on Capitol Hill were involved in drafting the order.  But officials said Bannon was the driving force throughout. The White House declined to comment on his role. Critics have accused Bannon of harboring anti-Semitic and white nationalist sentiments. Under Bannon’s leadership, his Breitbart website presented a number of conspiracy theories about Trump’s Democratic rival in the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton, as well as Republicans deemed to be lacking in conservative bona fides. Bannon has ascribed his interest in populism and American nationalism to a desire to curb what he views as the corrosive effects of globalization. He has rejected what he called the “ethno-nationalist” tendencies of some in the movement. After becoming chief executive of Trump’s election campaign in August, the former Goldman Sachs banker and Navy veteran helped lead him to victory over Clinton. He was then appointed by Trump as senior counselor and chief strategist - jobs not subject to U.S. Senate confirmation. He has been an almost constant presence by Trump’s side in the first 10 days of the administration - in the White House for a meeting with American manufacturers, at CIA headquarters the day after Trump was sworn in, and in the Oval Office during British Prime Minister Theresa May’s visit. He appears to have greatly expanded his power in the first 10 days of Trump’s presidency. Trump gave him an unprecedented seat in the NSC’s top-level meetings and potentially narrowed the role played by the director of national intelligence (DNI) and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Bannon has also asserted authority over almost all written statements from the White House and the NSC and has sent back documents for rewrites as he sees fit, one NSC official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.  Critics, including four senior U.S. intelligence officers, called the decision to formalize Bannon’s role at the NSC meetings a mistake, saying it risks politicizing decisions on national security. White House spokesman Sean Spicer on Monday defended Bannon’s inclusion in the NSC. Susan Rice, the former national security adviser in former President Barack Obama’s administration, tweeted on Sunday: “This is stone cold crazy. After a week of crazy.”  Bannon and Miller are drowning out the opinions of more moderate advisers like White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, said a senior DHS official and two people in Washington who work closely with the White House on immigration and a range of other issues. One of those people and the DHS official said Priebus felt he had placed enough of his fellow moderate Republicans in key positions at the White House as a counterbalance to Bannon and Miller, but he has been frustrated at their outsized influence so far, especially on issues of immigration and national security.  The White House dismissed the views of the officials as gossip.  politicsNews",1
"U.S. Senate panel postpones hearing for Labor nominee Puzder yet again WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate panel tasked with vetting Andrew Puzder to head the Labor Department has postponed its tentative plans to hold his confirmation hearing yet again, a move that some political strategists say could signal trouble for the fast-food executive. An aide for the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions said on Tuesday that the panel will not “officially” schedule a hearing “until the committee has received his paperwork from the Office of Government Ethics.” The committee had planned to hold Puzder’s hearing on Feb. 7. Prior to that, the committee eyed three other possible hearing dates. Puzder, who is the CEO of CKE Restaurants, is one of several  of President Donald Trump’s nominees who has faced particularly strong opposition from Senate Democrats and progressive groups. His nomination sparked protests by some CKE fast-food workers and the union-backed “Fight for $15” movement to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. George Thompson, a spokesman for Puzder, said Democrats and special interest groups were “obstructing President Trump’s nominees” and that Puzder is “a proven job creator.” Puzder has criticized an overtime rule championed by the Obama administration and opposes raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Last week, workers at franchised locations of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s, which are part of CKE’s restaurant portfolio, filed a range of complaints, alleging wage theft and harassment, among other things. Additionally, some of CKE’s racy advertisements featuring women in bikinis have caused Democrats to ask questions about how Puzder will address sexual harassment in the workplace. “I like our ads. I like beautiful women eating burgers in bikinis,” he was quoted as saying in a 2015 article in Entrepreneur magazine. He added that those ads “did take on my personality.” Experts say the repeated postponement of Puzder’s hearing and the delays over his ethics paperwork since he was first nominated on Dec. 8 are unusual and could be a sign of problems. “It is a likely sign that the vetting is turning up problems and they are trying to figure out how to deal with them,” said Matthew Miller, a partner at the crisis management firm Vianovo. The new delays come on the same day that the same committee voted along party lines to advance Betsy DeVos’ nomination as  education secretary to the full Senate floor. On another Senate panel, meanwhile, Democrats boycotted confirmation votes for Treasury Secretary-nominee Steve Mnuchin and Health and Human Services Secretary-nominee Tom Price.  politicsNews",1
"Gorsuch told he is likely Trump's Supreme Court pick: CNN WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Conservative U.S. appeals court judge Neil Gorsuch has been told he is likely President Donald Trump’s pick to fill a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court that has been vacant for almost a year, CNN reported on Tuesday, citing an unnamed source. Gorsuch, 49, who would replace the late Antonin Scalia, is a judge on the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. He was appointed by President George W. Bush in 2006. Some Democrats in the U.S. Senate, which votes on whether to confirm judicial nominees, have already said they would seek to block whoever Trump nominates.  politicsNews",1
"Senate committee approves Trump picks for Energy, Interior WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Senate Energy Committee on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved President Donald Trump’s nominees to head the Interior and Energy Departments. The panel approved Ryan Zinke for the Interior Department by a vote of 16 to 6 and Rick Perry, a former governor or oil producing Texas, for the Energy Department by a vote of 16 to 7. Next, the full Senate will consider both nominees.    politicsNews",1
"Exclusive: Trump administration to allow 872 refugees into U.S. this week - document WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government has granted waivers to let 872 refugees into the country this week, despite President Donald Trump’s executive order on Friday temporarily banning entry of refugees from any country, according to an internal Department of Homeland Security document seen by Reuters.  A Homeland Security official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the waivers, noting that the refugees were considered “in transit” and had already been cleared for resettlement before the ban took effect. Refugees preparing for resettlement typically have severed personal ties and relinquished their possessions, leaving them particularly vulnerable if their plans to depart are suddenly canceled.  The waivers, granted by the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), came amid international protests against Trump’s rushed executive order. Critics said the order in some cases was not clearly communicated to the agencies responsible for implementing it. It was not known if additional waivers would be granted, the official said. The document did not give the nationalities of the refugees who will be admitted into the United States.  Over the weekend, non-refugee visitors from seven majority-Muslim countries also targeted in Trump’s executive order were detained, deported and in some cases blocked from boarding flights to the United States. The countries covered by the traveler ban were Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Somalia, Libya and Yemen.  The internal DHS document said that between late Friday and early Monday 348 visa holders were prevented from boarding U.S.-bound flights. In addition, more than 200 people landed in the United States but were denied entry, the document showed. More than 735 people were pulled aside for questioning by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers in airports, including 394 legal permanent U.S. residents holding green cards, over the same time period.  Trump said the executive order he signed on Friday was designed to protect the United States “from foreign terrorist entry.” The order stopped all refugee admissions for 120 days while government officials determine how to ensure that any refugees admitted do not pose a threat. The 872 refugees to be admitted this week, under the waivers, were screened using Obama administration procedures, which typically take two years and include several interviews and a background check. The DHS said on Sunday night that green card holders would be allowed to board U.S.-bound flights, but would be subjected to additional scrutiny upon arrival.  The public guidance from DHS also said some people from the seven majority-Muslim countries could be allowed entry to the United States on a case-by-case basis.     Congressional Democrats and some foreign countries, including key U.S. allies, put pressure on Trump on Monday over the executive order. Democratic Senators tried to force a vote on a bill to rescind the order, but were blocked by a Republican lawmaker. Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said she had 27 co-sponsors for the legislation. But under Senate rules it takes only one member to prevent a vote, and Republican Senator Tom Cotton blocked consideration of the measure. The Democrats’ leader in the U.S. Senate, Chuck Schumer, said he would bring legislation on Monday evening seeking to end the ban, although the measure stood little chance of being passed by the Republican-led Congress.  politicsNews",1
"Ryan defends Trump immigration order but regrets confusion WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan on Tuesday defended President Donald Trump’s executive order on immigration and refugees, but said he regretted the confusion caused by its implementation. “The president has a responsibility to the security of this country,” Ryan told reporters. “It’s regrettable that there was confusion on the rollout of this. No one wanted to see people with green cards or special immigrant visas, like translators, get caught up in all of this.” The Wisconsin Republican said he spoke at length with U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and was “confident that he is, on a going forward basis, going to make sure that things are done correctly.”     politicsNews",1
"Trump pushes drugmakers for lower prices, more U.S. production WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday called on the pharmaceutical industry to boost U.S. production and lower prices, while also vowing to speed up approval times for new medicines and appoint a new U.S. Food and Drug Administration leader soon.  Shares of five of the six drug companies at the White House meeting with Trump were up more than 1 percent on average following the president’s remarks, compared with a 0.5 percent drop in the broad S&P 500. The Nasdaq Biotech Index was up 1.1 percent, reversing earlier losses, and the S&P 500 health care index gained 0.7 percent.      Attending the meeting were the CEOs of Novartis AG, Merck & Co Inc, Johnson & Johnson, Celgene Corp, Eli Lilly & Co and Amgen Inc as well as the head of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America lobbying group. Trump told the drugmakers that pricing had been “astronomical.” “We have to get prices down for a lot of reasons. We have no choice, for Medicare and Medicaid,” Trump said at the meeting, citing the nation’s government insurance programs for the elderly, the poor and the disabled that together are the largest U.S. purchaser of medications.    Trump also said currency devaluation by other countries had increased drugmakers’ outsourcing their production and called on the companies to make more of their products in the United States.  He added that foreign countries must pay fair share for drug development costs.  “We’re going to end global freeloading,” Trump said.  Novartis  CEO Joe Jimenez, who is chairman-elect of the industry lobbying group, said last week that he wanted to talk to Trump about efforts to develop pricing models that would pay for clinical results rather than a flat price per pill, as well as plans to replace the Affordable Care Act, which is popularly known as “Obamacare.” Trump spooked investors in the pharmaceuticals and biotech sectors by saying on Jan. 11, before his inauguration, that drug companies were “getting away with murder” on what they charged the government for medicine and that he would do something about it.  That prompted the pharmaceutical lobbying group to unveil a new TV marketing campaign last week to improve its image by focusing attention on strides in research. Company executives, meanwhile, have tried to tread a careful line in defending their industry while expressing optimism that the United States would continue to reward scientific advances.   politicsNews",1
" Hillary Reveals The ONE Person Who Made Her Lose… And It Isn’t Trump Hillary Clinton is speaking up after her election loss and coming forward with the facts on what contributed to the results. Despite the mainstream media s claims to the contrary, she points the finger at the extraordinary decision by FBI Director James Comey to interfere in the middle of the race. Just as we were back up on the upward trajectory, the second letter from Comey essentially doing what we knew it would saying there was no there there was a real motivator for Trump s voters,  Clinton said. Essentially, the second Comey letter played right into Trump s hands by giving new suspicions to those who believed the Washington establishment was helping Clinton win and pushed a surge in turnout.  Trump spent the last four days of this campaign engaged in a nonstop attack on me personally, and the result is the result,  Clinton said.The former presidential candidate also said she is  concerned  and  deeply saddened  for those who say they are living in fear in the United States after Trump s election.The decision by Comey was blasted by Democrats, and even some Republicans, as it gave the appearance that Clinton was still involved in wrongdoing, even though she had been previously cleared. It also fed into the mainstream media s obsession with Clinton s emails, which they covered more than nearly any other issue during the election.By contrast, Trump s refusal to release his tax returns hardly merited coverage, by comparison, nor did the shady dealings of his personal charity, the Trump Foundation.The press, in concert with the FBI and the right wing, weighed in on the election all against one candidate. While the right makes claims about  liberal media  bias, it is clear time and time again that they are weighing in on the behalf of the Republican side of the aisle and not the other.Featured image via Flickr News",0
" REPORT: Civil Rights Groups Say Voter Suppression Is Responsible For Trump’s Win In the wake of election day and Donald Trump s win, many Americans have been left scratching their heads and wondering just what the heck happened. According to a report by McClatchy, some civil rights groups say that voter suppression is what happened.Kristen Clarke, the president and executive director of the Lawyers  Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said that in hindsight,  we will find that voter suppression figured prominently in the story surrounding the 2016 presidential election. While voter suppression is hardly the only factor that brought us to this point, as McClatchy explains, it did play an important role. Fourteen states had restrictive new voting laws on the books for the first time in a presidential election this year, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law: Alabama, Arizona, Indiana, Kansas, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin.The laws included a mix of photo ID requirements for voters, cuts to early voting opportunities and curbs on voter registration activity. These laws began to spread across the country after the midterm elections of 2010, supposedly to protect against voter fraud, which is virtually nonexistent by the way.The Brennan Center reports that  10 states have imposed stricter voter ID laws, seven made registration more difficult, six have cut early voting opportunities and three have made it harder to restore voting rights to people with criminal convictions.  The center explains that these laws, which have been fueled by race and partisanship, disproportionately affect minorities, the poor, and younger voters; all groups who tend to lean to the left.Clarke said on Thursday that systemic barriers weren t the only obstacles voters faced this year. Long lines at polling places, voters whose names were missing from registration lists, a lack of assistance for non-English speaking voters, and  poll workers who requested strict photo ID in states where no such ID was required  also made it much harder to cast a ballot than it should have been.Wade Henderson, the president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said that groups monitoring the election  have documented beyond any doubt that voter suppression and a conscious effort to shave off 1 or 2 percent of the vote in key states, in all likelihood, influenced the outcome of this election. Activists also voiced concerns about purges of  inactive  voters from registration rolls in numerous states and a drastic reduction in polling places across the country.A report by the leadership conference found that voting locations were reduced in about 43 percent   or 165   of 381 counties that were previously covered by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. The result: There were 868 fewer sites in which to cast a ballot in those jurisdictions with histories of discriminatory voting practices.It is worth noting that many of these laws were only able to be enacted because of the gutting of the Voting Rights Act. While voter suppression is hardly the only factor responsible for Trump s win, it very well may have been what tipped the scales in his favor.Featured image via Sandbox News News",0
" Unhinged Ann Coulter Blames ‘Fat Girls’ For Trump Protests While this election was undeniably (from one side) meaner and more divisive than perhaps ever before, most elections do become mean and divisive, but the winning party usually calls for unity while the losing party licks its wounds.Non-Trump voting Americans are licking their wounds in their constitutionally (for now) protected way, by protesting. The media, of course, generally only reports on the worst of the protesters, while less attention has been paid to the rising violence and hate crimes from Trump supporters.Trump had this to say about the protests:Just had a very open and successful presidential election.

" One HUGE Way Liberals Are Already Fighting Back Against Trump While they are sad and in understandable despair, liberals are not simply sitting shell-shocked over the election of Donald Trump to the presidency. Very aware of the danger the newly elected Republican government will mean for vulnerable citizens, liberals are rushing to the defense of key organizations that have been targeted by Republicans.Few groups have been the subject of Republican and conservative attacks like Planned Parenthood has, and now liberals are letting them know they ve got their backs.Since the election, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America said it has received nearly 80,000 new donations nationwide, although it did not disclose the money amount.Planned Parenthood of Illinois said online appointments for long-acting contraceptives like IUDs, or intrauterine devices, rose nearly 50 percent in the past two days compared to the same period last week. It said it plans to increase the number of available appointments to meet demand. We have been overwhelmed by community members making donations and contacting us to offer to volunteer and provide support,  said Sarah Wheat, spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas, where successive Republican governors have cut funding to the organization.Republicans have gone after Planned Parenthood because they provide birth control and abortion access to women, regardless of income. The right has gone after them with hoax videos designed to implicate the group in criminal acts, brought its leaders before congress in order to berate them without cause, and voted over and over and over to cut federal funding.President Obama and congressional Democrats have repeatedly pushed back against the Republican onslaught, but many of the measures they have put in place have been weakened by sustained Republican obstruction over the last eight years. Many of these protections can be undone by a Trump presidency, and while Trump himself has not strongly pushed on the abortion issue, many Republicans will be looking to him in to attack women s health.Featured image via Flickr News",0
" Michael Moore LAYS WASTE To Anyone Who Says They Are ‘Christian’ Yet Supports Trump’s Bigotry If you claim to be a  Christian  but support Donald Trump and all the hate and bigotry he embodies, you re a hypocrite.And that s exactly what Michael Moore told Joy Reid during her Saturday morning show on MSNBC.Ever since Trump won the election on Tuesday night his deplorable supporters have been terrorizing minorities and women across the country, causing fear and panic in communities to the point that a movement has begun in which people wear safety pins to signify to others that they are safe to be near.But Moore believes more has to be done, particularly by white people. White people, no matter how painful, have a responsibility to reject anybody who stands in front of a camera who spews racism. Who spews sexism, misogyny. Who brags about being a sexual predator. I don t care what your race is, but especially if you re white. Because that means that you belong to the race that s been in power forever. This a country that was founded on genocide and built on the backs of slaves. So you have a special responsibility as a white person to always object to anybody who uses racism, who spews this hatred. Moore the wondered how white Americans will feel when they wake up one morning and realize that they ve been shitty human beings because they did nothing when they had a chance to stand against the hate. And that led to Moore calling out white people who call themselves  Christian. And do not call yourself a Christian if you are not willing, literally, to put your body in front of whoever is coming to hurt the other   the people who are not you. Here s the video via Twitter.MMFlint on the special responsibility he says white people have during #DonaldTrump presidency #AMJoy https://t.co/Ih87pHq8AB  AM Joy w/Joy Reid (@amjoyshow) November 12, 2016Moore is absolutely right. Because of Trump, the responsibility falls on white people to stand up against the racism, sexism, bigotry, and hate that he has incited against any American who isn t white or Christian. So whenever we see these behaviors we need to be brave and take a stand because being silent isn t an option.Featured Image: Screenshot News",0
" The Guy Trump Wants In Charge Of The Environment LITERALLY Hates Puppies As we are watching names being floated as part of Donald Trump s cabinet, it seems our greatest nightmares are beginning to unfold. The names being bandied about include Rudy Giuliani, who s never met a young black man he didn t think was a criminal, Jamie Dimon, the head of JPMorgan Chase and of crashing the economy fame, a Goldman Sachs exec, Sarah Palin and now, a puppy hater. Yes, a puppy hater.According to Politico, the top name for the Secretary of the Interior (the person in charge of the national parks and other public lands) is an oilman named Forrest Lucas. The San Francisco Gate also notes that other contenders include Sarah Palin, Arizona Governor Jan Brewer and Donald Trump Jr., who loves to trophy hunt.All of those picks would be disastrous for the environment, but Lucas is in a league of his own. He s the 74-year-old founder of Lucas Oil Products. He s also hated by animal rights activists. The victims of his financial attacks include the Humane Society, The Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. He s also a fan of puppy mills.He has defended puppy mills, circuses, animal agriculture and trophy hunting. A nonprofit that he founded and bankrolled produced the feature film  The Dog Lover,  which portrays dog breeders and puppy mills as victims of animal-rights agencies  who aren t REALLY interested in animal welfare. A review of the movie on Roger Ebert s website called it  shamelessly manipulative  and  a pretty bald piece of anti-SPCA and/or PETA propaganda. This is what the Humane Society says about Lucas:In 2010, Forrest Lucas spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to bankroll the opposition to Proposition B in Missouri, which voters approved to set common-sense standards for the care of dogs in large-scale commercial breeding operations (their statement against Prop B can be found here). Lucas then supported an effort in the Missouri legislature to weaken and repeal parts of the voter-approved measure, before it even had a chance to take effect.In 2012, Forrest Lucas spent more than a quarter-million dollars opposing Measure 5 in North Dakota, which sought to establish felony-level penalties for malicious cruelty to dogs, cats and horses.In 2013, Protect the Harvest lobbied against a local ordinance in Harrison County, Indiana, to promote the spaying and neutering of pets and help reduce pet overpopulation, and in Crawford County, Indiana, to provide adequate shelter for dogs and protect them from the elements.Trump has made his views on regulation very clear. Trump, to our knowledge, has never had a pet. That may or may not be a big deal to you, but he once posted a press release that complained about regulations that protect the safety of dog food.It s becoming increasingly clear that Donald Trump only cares about protecting his fortune and the fortunes of his ilk. He won t care if people lose health insurance or if seniors lose Social Security. He won t care if the nation loses its precious public lands or if the environment goes to hell. Trump ran for president for Trump. Humans, dogs, plants and other animals can get screwed.Featured image via Lucas Oil propaganda video screen capture News",0
" Trump Has Already Made Us The World’s Punch Line In A NAUSEATING Way Trump s biggest champion on the other side of the pond,  Mr. Brexit  himself, made a joke about Trump that s just a taste of how much the world is already laughing at us for electing him. Nigel Farage is reportedly meeting with Trump at some point very soon, but before he does that, he decided to go there: Don t touch her, for God s sake! Of course, he s referring to the Access Hollywood tape where Trump bragged about kissing women without their permission, and boasted that his star power allows him to do anything he wants, even  grab them by the pussy.  That tape should have sunk his candidacy and probably would have in every other civilized nation. It didn t here, the world got a huge shock, and now the world sees just how ridiculous we really can be.If that weren t true, Farage wouldn t have made that joke in a radio interview earlier this week. He wants to be the go-between for Trump and Theresa May, the U.K. s new prime minister, although he d really like to be Trump s ambassador to the E.U. (what could possibly go wrong there?). Don t touch her,  isn t all Farage said. He went on with: If it comes to it, I could be there as the responsible adult role, to make sure everything s OK. Oh holy hell. Farage has already been branded as the U.K. s Donald Trump, but this is ridiculous. A national leader joking about the sexual assault another national leader committed? Joking about playing the  responsible adult  when Trump meets with Theresa May (or maybe any other female leader)?We just threw up a little in our mouths.What Farage did, besides help Trump solidify our position as the world s biggest punch line, is marginalize and objectify his own prime minister. But that doesn t matter, because of course it doesn t. If there s any doubt, though, that the world is starting to whisper, cast furtive glances, chuckle, and then burst out with pointing and loud guffawing, it s this snippet from The Guardian: Farage could literally curl up on Trump s lap to stop him assaulting female premiers. If they widened his frottage-combating duties it could be a fulltime job   Trump will be in the presence of many females a day, and you have to remember he is a man whose sole, frequently stated reason for not coming on to his own daughter is the fact they re related. So Farage could be kept in the Oval Office as an anti-grope Jeeves. Congratulations, Trumpkins. One of the things you claimed Obama had done has now come true for real, and Trump hasn t even taken office yet.Featured image by Win McNamee via Getty Images News",0
" HBO’s ‘Silicon Valley’ Stars Harassed By Trump Supporters In Los Angeles Bar (TWEETS) After the election of Donald Trump, albeit not the popular vote by a long shot, many bigots everywhere are taking this as their cue to be as awful as possible. That somehow, just because a racist and misogynist got elected, that is their permission slip to verbally, or worse, physically assault people.It also looks that even liberal safe havens such as Los Angeles aren t even immune to this sort of bigotry that now seems justified to some.HBO s  Silicon Valley  stars Kumail Nanjiani and Thomas Middleditch were out at a bar in Silverlake, which is predominantly full of young liberal hipsters, and were approached by two men using white supremacist terminology.Nanjiani is Pakistani-American, and these two men apparently thought they could harass him and who he was with. Was it because of the color of his skin? Or was it just because they re actors who stood against Trump? Really, who s to know, but I bet most of us can take a wild guess.Here s Nanjiani s thread explaining the altercation with Middleditch chiming in:Was at a bar last night with @Middleditch.

Thomas Middleditch (@Middleditch) November 12, 2016We thought Internet would give us access to ppl w different points of view. Instead it gives us access to many ppl w the same point of view.  Kumail Nanjiani (@kumailn) November 12, 2016This can t be the America we live in. We need to stand up against hate where it stands and not allow these hateful individuals to think they can be as horrendous as they want. Not today. Not ever.Featured Photo by Alberto E.

" CHAOS In Washington As Trump Avoids Real Work And His Transition Team Eats Itself Alive A mere four days after Trump got exactly what he claimed he wanted, his transition team is plagued with infighting, shake-ups and general chaos, just like his campaign. Chris Christie was heading up the transition team, but now that job has gone to Mike Pence. There s also little evidence that Trump himself is even working all that much.He couldn t run a campaign, now he can t run his transition team, so how can anybody expect him to run a country? Already, reports are coming out that he s hinting he d rather stay in his gilded castle at the top of Trump Tower, or down at Mar-a-Lago in Florida. Trump s terror at the drastic change his life is about to undergo, along with his general incompetence at, well, pretty much everything, mean he could easily become an absentee president.Those reports are also alleging that Trump wants to spend a lot of time doing exactly what he did on the campaign trail: Holding huge rallies. He needs the applause. He needs the adoration. He needs to be seen and heralded and worshiped like the god he s not. Some are trying to spin this as a good thing: I think Trump has discovered that these rallies are tremendous opportunities for him to get his message out,  said Christopher Ruddy, chief executive of Newsmax Media, a conservative website.  It s actually sort of old-fashioned, that you want to actually meet people and press the flesh with him. We re sure that s the reason. What about the actual work of being president, though? That s possibly not even on his radar right now.He s already an absentee president-elect   the only contact he s had with his transition team has been through Christie. Fissures are appearing between New Yorkers who worked on the campaign and think of themselves as outsiders and Washington team-builders who ve been quietly laying the groundwork for an actual administration.The New Yorkers view those people as nothing more than pencil-pushers, while the Washington group views the New Yorkers as interlopers.There s a rift emerging between Corey Lewandowski and Reince Priebus over who s going to head the RNC. Lewandowski s allies also see Priebus, who s up for White House Chief of Staff, as the very establishment insider they supposedly don t want.Social and fiscal conservatives from places like The Heritage Foundation find themselves annoyed with Chris Christie and his allies, whom they view as not conservative enough to even be there.Then there are his kids, who are playing pivotal roles in the transition and raising eyebrows about how they re going to manage a blind trust while working directly with or even leading the transition team and administration. Their involvement with the transition is creating some serious problems: That s a fight you can t win,  one of the people said.  The Christie people are from New Jersey, they act like they re in charge, and Jared Kushner is like,  You re not really in charge.' Trump has praised some of his closest allies from the campaign, but the transition is shaping up to look like his campaign. Actually, it will be multiplied by about a billion since this team is responsible for several thousand hires and placements within the administration, and Trump can t run a bare-bones administration while still doing whatever he wants.And Trump has quietly retreated, like he always does, seemingly under the assumption that since he s the boss, he just has to stand around, look pretty, and listen to the loudly cheering crowds, and doesn t have to be around and actually do any real work.Featured image by Zach Gibson via Getty Images News",0
" Michelle Obama Poses In A Pretty Dress, So Racist Conservatives Call Her A ‘Monkey’ (SCREENSHOTS) Trump fans may have won the election, but they aren t taking a break from expressing their racist hatred of Michelle Obama. The Donald s Deplorables were out in force after the First Lady posed for the cover of Vogue. I could have spent eight years doing anything, and at some level, it would have been fine,  Obama told the magazine.  I could have focused on flowers. I could have focused on decor. I could have focused on entertainment. Because any first lady, rightfully, gets to define her role. There s no legislative authority; you re not elected. And that s a wonderful gift of freedom. In exercising her freedom, Michelle Obama has done quite a bit to push education, healthy eating, and support for our veterans   and in exercising their freedom, the Right has responded with nothing but hate. The reaction to the First Lady appearing in elegant clothing was typical. Readers of Yahoo News showered Obama with racist remarks, calling her an  ape  and a  monkey  and even wishing death upon her for the horrific crime of wearing pretty clothes.            If you thought this behavior would stop after the election, you were wrong. Trump fans are not done by a long shot   and now they have been emboldened by America electing its first official KKK candidate.It will get worse before it gets better.Featured image via Vogue/screengrabs News",0
" Trump Is Already Creating A STRIKING Double Standard With Requirements For His Administration One of the major issues of the 2016 campaign was Trump s taxes, and the reason everyone made such a big deal of it was the fact that, except for a financial disclosure that was about as vague as possible, he was being as opaque as he could. It s hard to trust someone who s that opaque. For applicants for his transition team and administration? They have to be transparent about it, which reveals massive double standards on Trump s part.The transition team s website, GreatAgain.gov, says: Financial holdings and sources of income must be disclosed. Any conflicts must be remedied by divestiture, the creation of special trusts, and other actions. Okay, so they can do that with financial disclosures rather than their tax returns. In fact, they ll be required to file those financial disclosures. But then there s this, which is where Trump s hypocrisy comes in: You will be asked about possible conflicts of interest deriving from your sources of income; all aspects of your personal and professional life, including organization [sic] which you belong or once belonged; speeches you may have given and books, articles and editorials you may have written; legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings to which you may have been a party; in short, anything that might embarrass the President or you if he should choose you for a position in his administration. This refers, in part, to the SF-86, which is required for anyone in order to gain a security clearance. The kicker is this: Even knowing that these job candidates have to give out sensitive and detailed information about their lives, it shows that Trump is applying a different set of standards to himself than those by which his workforce must abide.Trump gets away with being opaque to everyone and probably pats himself on the back for it, and can continue to be so while his candidates will have to be forthcoming and detailed. He can even continue to lie about things that are important to gain the public s trust. His candidates?Nope.The SF-86 is ridiculously thorough, and it s an ungodly pain in the ass to fill out because of that, even through the online e-Qip system. It asks for a lot of financial information (along with just about everything else that was ever in your life) including bankruptcies, tax liens, repossessions, judgments entered against you, and more. A lot of this is information that Trump has flatly lied about, denied, or downplayed. His candidates don t have that luxury.Information provided on the SF-86 is covered under the Privacy Act, so his candidates  info will not be made public, even through a FOIA request. Someone handling those forms and investigations would have to get stupid in order for that info to be made public.The double standard remains, though. Trump is a hypocrite who is already making it clear that he won t live or govern by the same standards that everyone else must live and/or govern. That s absurd.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images News",0
" Trump Reverses Himself On Obamacare And Conservatives Throw A Temper Tantrum Well, well, well, look what we have here.During his meeting with President Obama, Donald Trump apparently was convinced that repealing Obamacare is probably not a good idea after all.According to the Wall Street Journal, Trump told reporters after the meeting that he may just simply  amend  Obama s signature healthcare law and said he would consider suggestions the president made during their discussion. Either Obamacare will be amended, or repealed and replaced,  Trump said.  I told him I will look at his suggestions, and out of respect, I will do that. It s not a guarantee, but it s definitely a reversal from he has been telling his supporters throughout his campaign for the last year and a half.Republicans have been trying to destroy the healthcare law for years and even shut the government down in protest of the law. They were hoping Donald Trump would be a rubber stamp to their agenda and now it turns out President Obama may have reasoned with Trump. And considering over 100,000 Americans have signed up for an Obamacare health plan already this year and repealing the law could seriously hurt millions of Americans, including conservatives, it looks like Trump has changed his tune on a core campaign promise.And of course, his supporters are already starting to throw a hissy fit about it.@thehill KEEP YOUR PROMISE AND REPEAL IT DON T SELL US OUT BEFORE YOU ARE SOWRN IN KEEP YOUR WORD &DON T LET US DOWN  ERNIE (@GRANDPASOF) November 11, 2016@thehill watch it! This is not why I voted for you. You said  repeal and replace . Hell, Hillary was going to  keep parts of obamacare  Suzy Z (@suzyq10867) November 11, 2016@WSJ wrong   wrong   wrong   wrong   it must be totally repealed  Mr Dane A Wolfe (@MrDaneAWolfe) November 11, 2016 @WSJ: Donald Trump willing to keep parts of health law https://t.co/rlRKQLrTgD What? We haven t heard that from Trump yet. Maybe 1-5% OK.  Deplorable Highlandr (@Incogneato76) November 11, 2016@WSJ hahahahaha not even sworn in yet and backing off one of the most fucked up laws in the books Obamacare sucks and needs to end !  Jeff Berghuis (@JeffS_Berghuis) November 11, 2016Whether Trump actually keeps or repeals Obamacare is yet to be seen. But it s entertaining watching his supporters lose what s left of their minds whining about being lied to by a known liar.Featured Image: Pete Souza News",0
" Top First Amendment Lawyer Makes MIND-BLOWING Suggestion To Media: Sue Trump (TWEET) The election of reality television star Donald Trump has people all over the world responding in various ways. Some of us are in total shock, despair and disbelief, and some of us are finding creative ways to resist this presidency. First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams is amongst those raising eyebrows with an unprecedented suggestion for Americans.On Wednesday night, during a dinner hosted by the Media Law Resource Center, the top lawyer made a suggestion that shocked everyone. First, he called Trump  the greatest threat to the First Amendment since the passage of the Sedition Act of 1798.  And then he surprised everyone again when he suggested that reporters should think about suing Trump.When Abrams, who is the most well-known First Amendment lawyer in the country, was asked for clarification, he said: It s seems to be that in light of the attacks made by then-Candidate Trump against the press on a continuing basis his preventing certain journalists from even attending his rallies as part of the press corps because he disapproved for their writing, and his public comments about wanting to loosen American libel law the press ought to be thinking broadly about how to defend itself if his Administration turns out to be as antagonistic to the press as may be the case. Abrams also cited libel law, and suggested that Trump be sued by the media for defamation. Abrams warned the press that it should be trying to protect itself, as Trump has threatened several times to prevent the media from speaking negatively about him. It may well be necessary to think outside the box in response to a deliberately repressive administration. It s because the level of hostility to the press, and perhaps the willingness to limit or punish press criticism may reach a new height in this administration. Although Abrams mentioned that this would be a first for American journalists, maybe it s time that changed. The press is used to defending libel cases. That s a good part to what I ve done in my career. So as to protect free speech and free expression as much as possible. I m not seeking to move away from that. My plea is to bear in mind that one of the potential weapons is that when anyone president or shoemaker defames an entity, and speaks falsely and maliciously, one of the possible responses is to bring a libel suit. Trump has spent days on Twitter bashing the media and condemning journalists for speaking the truth about him. Even after the election, Trump has continued to criticize the media for doing its job. Just days after winning the election, Trump was back at it again: TwitterFeatured image via Joe Raedle / Getty Images News",0
